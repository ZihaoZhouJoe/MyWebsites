    <p>I am the fourth person in black starting from the left side.</p>  
    
    <p>During my summer vacation time before becoming a senior, I worked in a local bank in California. My work along with other workmate was to classify the food into different kinds. Most of the food was offered and donated by local stores, and the food bank would distribute the food to the homeless. I had to check if the food was expired or not. The working condition was a bit messy due to food being spread around. Even the work was hard, I still enjoyed it as fun. More importantly, I learned how hard the workers' jobs were and how happy the homeless would be when they received the healthy food from the food bank.</p>
